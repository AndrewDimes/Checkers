# Checkers
Checkers is a classic board game, dating back to around 3000 BC. It is very simple, but a lot of fun! The game is played on an 8x8 chequered board. Each player starts with 12 pieces, placed on the dark squares of the board closest to them. The objective of the game is to capture all the opponent's pieces by jumping over them.

For building this game I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Some features I hope to implement in the future are highlighted possible moves, double jump, and a king function for pieces that make it to the other end of the board.
